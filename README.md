## About

This is my personal website, where I write about me and share my resume.

Im using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## How to run?

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

That's it. Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
